# HASCO Repo Automated Tests

This project contains automated tests for the HASCO Repository application using Java, Maven, and Selenium WebDriver.

---

## System Requirements

Before running the tests, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### 1. Java Development Kit (JDK)

- **Version:** OpenJDK 11 or higher (Java 11+)
- **Download:**  
  - [Adoptium OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) (recommended)  
  - [OpenJDK official](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
- **Environment Variable:**  
  You must set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable pointing to your JDK installation directory.  
  - On Windows:
    ```batch
    setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Path\To\OpenJDK11"
    ```
  - On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/openjdk11
    ```

### 2. Apache Maven

- **Version:** Maven 3.6.0 or higher
- **Download:** [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **Environment Variable:**  
  You must set the `MAVEN_HOME` environment variable pointing to your Maven installation directory, and add Maven's `bin` folder to your system `PATH`.  
  - On Windows:
    ```batch
    setx MAVEN_HOME "C:\Path\To\Maven\apache-maven-3.8.6"
    setx PATH "%PATH%;%MAVEN_HOME%\bin"
    ```
  - On Linux/macOS:
    ```bash
    export MAVEN_HOME=/path/to/maven/apache-maven-3.8.6
    export PATH=$PATH:$MAVEN_HOME/bin
    ```

### 3. Web Browser and WebDriver

- **Browser:** Google Chrome (recommended)
- **WebDriver:** ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome version.  
  Download from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)  
  Place the `chromedriver` executable in a folder included in your system `PATH` or specify its location programmatically in the tests.

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/hascorepo.git
   cd hascorepo
    ```

2. **Verify Java and Maven installations**

   ```bash
   java -version
   mvn -version
   ```

   Both commands should print version information matching the requirements above.

---

## Running the Tests

The tests are configured to run with Maven and use Selenium WebDriver to automate browser actions.

### Run all tests

```bash
mvn clean test
```

### Run a specific test class

For example, to run the `FullSetupWSandNHANES` test only:

```bash
mvn clean test -Dtest=FullSetupWSandNHANES
```

### Test Reports

* Test execution logs and reports are generated by Maven Surefire in the directory:

  ```
  target/surefire-reports/
  ```

* Individual test console outputs (including any `System.out.println` or logging) are saved in `.txt` files within this directory.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **JAVA\_HOME or MAVEN\_HOME not set**

  Make sure both environment variables are correctly configured and pointing to valid installation directories.

* **WebDriver errors**

  Ensure the ChromeDriver version matches your installed Chrome browser version.

* **Permission issues**

  On Linux/macOS, verify that ChromeDriver has execution permissions:

  ```bash
  chmod +x /path/to/chromedriver
  ```

---

## Additional Notes

* This project uses **Selenium 4.26.0** and **JUnit 5.9.0**.
* Tests run in **headless mode** by default for compatibility with CI environments. You can configure this in the test source code if needed.
* For detailed debug logs, run Maven with the `-X` flag:

  ```bash
  mvn clean test -X
  ```
